Ever wanted to stake Echelon to benefit from those sweet staking rewards but felt that the standard 21 days unbonding time was too much of a commitment?

SWECH is the receipt token for permanently locking ECH into Lockless Protocol. SWECH-ECH Liquidity tokens can be Staked to earn Rewards from Echelon Staking. Unlike normally staked ECH coins, the SWECH is fully Liquid & can be sold on [ABcDeFx](https://abcdefx.eliteness.network/) anytime for ECH, and this quality of SWECH virtually removes the 21 day locking period. All SWECH are backed by atleast 1 ECH, ensuring its peg algorithmically.

Lockless is provided by [ECH.Guru](https://ech.guru/) that has other offerings as well, check out [their site](https://ech.guru/)!
