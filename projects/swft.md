SWFT handles bridging across different blockchains and ecosystems with ease. Transactions are fast and the user interface is super easy to operate. Just connect the wallets and enjoy the beauty of cross-chain transactions in it's purest form!

### Road to Echelon

The strong suite of SWFT is that it supports trading assets straight to native ECH. If you're looking for a simple, all-in-one and safe way to get ECH, SWFT is a great option.

Be sure to check other Echelon compatible bridges as well in the [project list](https://ech.world/projects/)!
