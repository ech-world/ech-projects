We pride ourselves in producing inclusive, non-biased, and community driven statistics for the decentralised finance industry. We do our best to treat all projects equally with regards to what is and isn't included in TVL, how long it takes to list or update a project's TVL, and everything else.
DefiLlama provides live data for over 120 blockchains including Echelon. There are also different levels of [APIs](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) that have public endpoints for live and historical data.
