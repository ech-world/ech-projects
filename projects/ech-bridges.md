One of the most useful and cool things about Echelon is that it can be bridged without extra fees to and from multiple blockchains. You only need to cover the base gas fees on both sides of the bridge. And on Echelon side even the gas fees are extremely low. This opens up a lot of potential for those that need to move assets across chains. Echelon provides a reliable and fast way to do just that.

### Compatible blockchains

With Echelon bridges you can bridge Echelon to and from:
* [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/smartChain)
* [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)
* [Avalance](https://www.avax.network/)
* [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)
* [Cronos](https://cronos.org/)
* [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/)

The token used for Echelon on external chains is bECH (bridged Echelon). There are also many other bridges that support Echelon, including stable coin bridging, feel free to check them out from the [project list](https://ech.world/projects)! 

### Instructions

To get some Echelon, one way is to bridge it from another blockchain. For example if you're used to Binance Smart Chain, you can buy BNB or some other BSC compatible asset, transfer it to your Metamask wallet (make sure [Metamask is connected to BSC network](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)), swap/trade it to bECH in a DEX (like PancakeSwap etc.) and then bridge it to Echelon network ([Metamask needs to be connected to Echelon network](https://docs.ech.network/quick-start) also). As a note, when trading bECH, always make sure you're using correct contracts, you can find the contract hashes from [official Echelon docs](https://docs.ech.network/quick-start/echelon-bridge/contracts-and-ibc).

Bridging is done with the [Echelon dapp](https://app.ech.network/). You only need to make sure you have enough funds for gas fees on Echelon and the chain your bridging to/from. Please also notice that if you're transfering from native Echelon, you need to wrap it to wECH. And if you're transfering to Echelon it will appear to your wallet as wECH which you can unwrap to native Echelon (if you want to stake your funds, they need to be native Echelon). Wrapping and unwrapping is done with the [wrap/unwrap tool](https://app.ech.network/wrap) in dapp.

If your Metamask wallet is already connected to Echelon dapp and you have enough funds for gas then it's a matter of filling the required information to the bridge tool. Full instructions can be found in [official Echelon docs](https://docs.ech.network/quick-start/echelon-bridge).

### Support

If a bridge transaction fails for some reason, there's a separate [repair tool](https://app.ech.network/tools) in Echelon dapp . If there's any problems that you need support from the team or community, be sure to connect to Echelon Discord server and ask freely, please find the links to community channels [here](https://ech.world/community).
