Welcome to defyswap.finance, home to the most advanced DEX experience Echelon has seen thus far. Defy can be pronounced "Dee-fi," both pronunciations are welcome.

### The Ultimate Goal

Our goal here at the Defy is to bring an incredible DEX experience with advanced trading tools. We provide all the tools you need to be a successful trader in one place.

### What Makes defyswap ($DFY) Different?

We believe in decentralizing finance. We also strongly believe that DEX is the way forward. There is no dearth of DEXs on any chain but most of them are copies of either Uniswap or Pancakeswap, where, both models have their inherent disadvantages. We have spotted those disadvantages and decided to launch DEFYSWAP, a model where the issues identified are being taken care of.

While maintaining all of the usual features you've come to expect from any DEX (Automated Market Making AMM, Swapping/Trading, Liquidity Pools, Yield Farming & Pools). There are a few other unique features we have looked to integrate to insure one of the strongest user experiences possible for all around future viability and user utility.

* Fixed Supply (10,000,000)
* Limit Orders (Soon to be added)
* Impermanent Loss Protection ()
* Futuristic UI -- [Check it out here](https://docs.defyswap.finance/data-assets/ui)

Through constant assessment and re-assessment and hours upon hours of work, we feel we have designed an entire user experience that will allow you to take your crypto trading skillset to the next level and ensure that you can always be making the most well informed decisions as the tools are readily at hand.

The beauty of the Defy team being ground level and developing everything custom all the way up vs just a simple copy and paste clone is that we are capable of truly receiving community feedback to allow for quick additions / customization of Defyswap features to further advance the capabilities of the DEX as a whole!
Long description of the project.
