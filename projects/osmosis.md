Osmosis Frontier makes it possible to easily trade Echelon in the Cosmos ecosystem. It is a DEX based on full permissionless listing and curation of assets. There are dozens of assets ready for swapping. All packaged in a neat interface!

### IBC

With Osmosis, you can deposit and withdraw your ECH via [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/) (inter-blockchain communication). The IBC transactions are done through the [IBC page](https://app.ech.network/ibc) of the [Echelon dapp](https://app.ech.network/).
