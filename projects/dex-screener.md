DEX Screener offers realtime price charts and trading history on DEXes across different ecosystems. They were one of the first services to host live market data of Echelon assets. If you're looking for old historical data for Echelon/bECH (pre-CG and CMC), DEX Screener probably has what you're looking for. And for on-chain assets, they've got them [listed with full data](https://dexscreener.com/echelon) for price, volume, liquidity etc.
